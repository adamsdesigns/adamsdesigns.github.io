		                <p>Before anything can be done with the satellite imagery, it first needs to be found. This means knowing where in the world the image should be captured from, the date of capture, and the type of image needed. In order to do this, a feature of the platform called catalog search enables  exploration of satellite imagery by allowing users to search by location and see image results on a map.</p>
		                <p>The existing version of this feature was an MVP, released to test the market and understand how it could evolve to better help customers. However, there were still some major problems in the way imagery was acquired using this tool. This is where my role on the new 'Data Platform' team began. The team consisted of a Product Manager, 7 Frontend and Backend engineers and myself as the designer.</p>

				      	<p>UP42's largest customers are using the platform for buying satellite data. The biggest purchase to date was for high resolution 'Pleiades' satellite imagery.</p>
				      	<p>While catalog search is able to search for imagery, there is still no easy way to buy and download it. Customers still need to manually copy code parameters of their desired image and configure a workflow to retrieve the images. The graph shows failures in 'job outputs' and 'Pleiades job failures' (the results of a workflow) indicating that this is an extremely error prone way of acquiring images, causing much frustration.</p>

				      	<p>UP42 has a small number of committed users who are in regular contact with the sales and support teams. Feedback and requests are received into Productboard and are then used to help the product teams figure out what problems to focus on. There were some trends emerging from this data.</p>
				      	<p>Over the course of developing the feature, I also conducted testing sessions with both existing users as well as members of the Geospatial industry. For the first iteration I tested the existing version of the feature to gain a deeper understanding of the pain points. I found very similar problems to the customer support issues. Based on this initial feedback, I had plenty of insights into the core problems to focus on.</p>

		                <p>It was also time to address the next major business goal of UP42, the ability to use data for insights (with UP42's library of processing algorithms). This feature was not integrated well and catalog search lacked a user friendly way to analyze the data using workflows, a core part of the product offering.</p>
		                <p>Based on some further customer feedback and testing calls I also found the following problems with the ordering experience:</p>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>During checkout, there's not a clear enough mechanism that an order is being placed.</li>
		                    <li>The amount being spent still isn't clear enough.</li>
		                    <li>Understanding the differences and capabilities of different data products is difficult.</li>
		                    <li>Understanding what items are in storage isn't clear.</li>
	                	</ul>
		                <p><strong>This led to the following improvements:</strong></p>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>Enable the configuration of 'Jobs' a.k.a triggering data analysis straight from catalog search.</li>
		                    <li>Add better guardrails to the checkout flow to increase users confidence and provide further information around pricing.</li>
		                    <li>Categorizing and filtering image results by capability and introducing a product configuration panel for each image.</li>
		                    <li>Storage improvements that provide more details about purchased imagery.</li>

                	<p>After the initial release of the new ordering feature there was a continuous increase in its usage, including from the company's main customers.</p>
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Number of orders increased over time, and core customers adopted the feature. To date, over 350k of revenue has been made.</li>

                	<p>Catalog search was a feature that I worked on over the course of a year and a half within a cross functional team. Further challenges included integrating more satellite data offerings and enabling custom order requests.</p>
