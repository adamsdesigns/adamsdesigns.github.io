                        <p>As in-house senior product designer, I designed a tool that enables the exploration and purchasing of large amounts of satellite imagery through a map driven interface.</p>

                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p class="intro">Helping customers find and purchase 510.1 million km² worth of earth imagery.</p>
                <p>Satellites are photographing every inch of land on earth, every single day. It’s UP42’s mission to open up access to this data and to help people unlock critical information to better understand the planet.</p>
                <p><strong>What is UP42?</strong></p>
                <p>UP42 is a developer platform and marketplace offering a wide range of geospatial data and analytics. A core aspect of the platform is enabling customers to construct 'workflows' that take satellite imagery, apply processing algorithms and extract insights from the imagery. However, the only way to see and purchase available imagery is by executing a ‘test run’ of your workflow and repeating until you find something appropriate. There’s no guarantee the test run will return what you’re looking for. Catalog search was created to solve this problem.</p>
                <p><strong>The team and our focus</strong></p>
                <p>Catalog search is a tool that enables the exploration of satellite imagery by allowing users to search and see image results on a map. The MVP of this feature was released to test the market and understand how it could evolve to better help customers. This is where my role on the new “Data Platform” team began. The team consisted of a Product Manager, 7 Frontend and Backend engineers and myself as the designer.</p>

                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p class="intro">Enable an error free and intuitive ordering experience.</p>
                <p>Currently UP42's largest customers are using the platform for buying satellite data. The biggest purchase to date was for high resolution 'Pleiades' satellite imagery.</p>
                <p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
                <p>While searching for imagery has been made much easier with catalog search, there is still no easy way to buy it. Customers still need to manually copy code parameters of their desired image and configure a workflow to retrieve the images. The following graph shows failures in “job outputs” and “Pleiades data job failures” (the results of a workflow) indicating that this is an extremely error prone way of purchasing images.</p>
                <img src="images/customer-data-1.png" style="margin: 24px 0 56px;">
                <p><strong>Customer feedback and user testing</strong></p>
                <p>UP42 has a small number of committed users who have regular conversations with sales and support. Through these conversations, numerous feedback and requests are received. These requests are ‘triaged’ into Productboard which are then used to help the product teams figure out what problems to focus on.</p>
                <p>Over the course of developing the feature, I conducted a number of testing sessions with both existing users as well as members of the Geospatial industry. For the first iteration I tested the existing version of the feature to gain a deeper understanding of the pain points. I found similar problems to the customer support issues. Time and time again I heard the same thing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Copying the parameters into a workflow to buy data is tedious and unintuitive."</li>
                    <li>"It’s not clear how much I’m spending."</li>
                    <li>"It’s not easy to access and re-use purchased data."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on this initial feedback, I had plenty of insights into the core problems to focus on.</p>
                <p><strong>For the first iteration, the focus was:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ordering and checkout process to enable easy purchasing of data and transpacency into pricing.</li>
                        <li>Storage feature to enable access and re-use of purchased data.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h2>Iterating</h2>
                <p class="intro">Refining the feature</p>
                <p>Customers now had the ability to easily order and download satellite data, however using that data for insights (with UP42s library of processing algorithms) was not integrated well. Catalog search lacked a user friendly way to analyze the data using “workflows”, a core part of the product offering and a major business goal.</p>
                <p>Based on some further customer feedback and testing calls I also found the following problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During checkout, there's not a clear enough mechanism that an order is being placed.</li>
                    <li>The amount being spent still isn’t clear enough.</li>
                    <li>Understanding the differences and capabilities of different data products is difficult.</li>
                    <li>Finding specific items in storage isn’t easy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>This led to the following improvements:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable the configuration of “Jobs” a.k.a triggering data analysis straight from catalog search.</li>
                    <li>Add better guardrails to the checkout flow to increase users confidence and provide further information around pricing.</li>
                    <li>Categorizing and filtering image results by capability and introducing a product configuration panel for each image.</li>
                    <li>Storage improvements that provide more details about purchased imagery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p class="intro">The proof is in the numbers</p> 
                <p>After the initial release of the new ordering feature there was a continuous increase in its usage, including from the company’s main customers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of orders increased over time, and core customers adopted the feature. To date, over 350k of revenue has been made.</li>
                    <li>Reduction in workflow parameter copies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since this is a feature that I worked on as part of a cross-functional product team, we continuted to iterate and make improvements on it over the course of a year and a half. Further challenges included integrating more satellite data offerings and enabling custom order requests.</p>
