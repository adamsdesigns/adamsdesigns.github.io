		            <p>As an independent contractor, I worked with an agency to redesign an iOS app that uses AI technology to help people find and purchase the perfect fitting shoes.</p>

			<p class="intro-large">There's a lot of uncertainty shopping for shoes online. Despite knowing your shoe size, different brands and shoe types always fit differently. This is the purpose of <span>FTSY, an app that helps you find new brands and unique styles in the right size</span> by matching your foot size to the perfect shoes.</p>
			<p class="intro-large">My job was to reimagine the shoe shopping experience to help people find the perfect fitting shoes.</p>

				      	<h3>User Testing</h3>
				      	<p>What's unique about FTSY is the interactive scanning experience that determines the size of your feet in order to make shoe recommendations. Though innovative, the app was experiencing slow adoption and a high failure rate in usage.</p>
				      	<p>My first priority was to understand how potential FTSY users went about shopping for shoes online.</p>
				      	<p>I conducted 5 user testing sessions where I got each person to try the FTSY app while getting insights into what a great shopping experience looked liked for each of them. I moderated each testing session in person and compiled the results into a report outlining key findings and recommendations.</p>

		                <p>All 5 participants failed to perform a foot scan on their own. Each time I heard the same thing: "It's too much work and I need instructions while doing it." The app provided instructions before the scan, but there was not enough guidance or feedback during the process. Every person found it too complex.</p>
		                <p>4 out of 5 of the test participants also felt that they weren't confident with the app suggesting a size. They doubted its accuracy and weren't fully confident purchasing if the suggested size was different to their regular size.</p>
		                <p>With this in mind, I designed a scanning experience that is much faster and easier to use by focusing on clear step-by-step instructions and a better sense of progress.</p>

				      	<p>I made the images larger, showed the available colours and price more prominently and made the product descriptions easier to find. I also changed the colour and copy of the purchase button because test participants were hesitant about what the next step would be.</p>

				      	<p>The product page presented another opportunity to use sizing reassurance to help customers feel more confident in making a purchase. I made sure that sizing results from the scan were included and displayed more prominently. Personalized information explained why this size was being suggested.</p>

		                <p>5 out of 5 test participants revealed that they wanted to jump straight in and browse for shoes. Instead the app forced them through a bloated onboarding process where they had to create an account and scan their feet first.</p>
		                <p>This led to changing the structure of the app and removing parts of the onboarding flow that caused so much confusion. Instead, the new design allowed users to freely browse all the shoes as soon as possible before they needed to scan their feet and enter any account details. At the same time, there was always a subtle reminder to make sure that users perform the core function of the app - to scan their feet for the right size.</p>
		                <p>I also designed a more engaging browsing experience. The homepage now better guided the user to products of interest and filtering was introduced into the results screens.</p>
